# Approach of Task 2
Well this task was a trouble for me. I began this task with cloning the given repository and I chose the Hugo theme I loved. Going forward with the task, I had a lots of problems which I had to face. Some of them I couldnâ€™t solve at the beginning. Due to these problems, I had to redo the task 4 times. At the end, I was able to find a solution to these problems and I was able to create the blog post successfully and complete task-02.
