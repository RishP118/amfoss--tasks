# Approach of Task 7
This task was a not easy and not hard task. I had to create a HTML code for this and create an JavaScript file. I had to also generate an API key and get the URL for this, which was hard for me. I had to also deploy this as a Chrome extension. At the end, I created a CSS file to design the background and do some adjustments for the extension. And finally, I completed task-07.
