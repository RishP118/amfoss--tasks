# amfoss--tasks
## INTRODUCTION
I am Rishi Priyan. I am from Madurai, Tamil Nadu. I am a part of S1 CSE batch in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam, Amritapuri. I was studying in Qatar from class 1 to class 12th. My hobbies are listening to Tamil songs, playing video games, etc. I also love travelling. I used to play cricket and badminton.
## WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?
I come to the amfoss club with a strong desire to learn about the world of programming. I'm adaptable and eager to explore various programming languages. I'm committed to putting in the time and effort required to master coding concepts and languages. While I may face challenges, I approach problems with patience and a determination to overcome them, embracing each coding obstacle as an opportunity to learn.
## WHAT'S MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS?
Since this is the first year, everyone have their own dreams like how their life will be in this college, how much fun will they have, the amount of knowledge they are going to gain, etc. Like that, even I have some thoughts. For now, my plan is to develop my knowledge about coding, learn about problem solving, and also have some fun with my  friends.
## HOW WILL I CONTIBUTE TO THE CLUB?
Well, I will contribute by participating in coding challenges, workshops, etc. I'll also participate inprojects, solve problems and come up with innovative solutions. I will also do my best to contribute to this club and help the club in the best way.
