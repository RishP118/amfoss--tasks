My hobbies are listening to Tamil songs, playing video games, etc. I also love travelling. I used to play cricket and badminton.
## WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?
I come to the amfoss club with a strong desire to learn about the world of programming. I'm adaptable and eager to explore various programming languages. I'm committed to putting in the time and effort required to master coding concepts and languages. While I may face challenges, I approach problems with patience and a determination to overcome them, embracing each coding obstacle as an opportunity to learn.
