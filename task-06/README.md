# Approach of Task 6
During my 11th and 12th grade in school, I learnt about python for 2 years. So, it took just a few days to learn how to create the bot and then create it also. It was fun as well. It was like the same as task-05. This is because over there I was given a website which we had to recreate. And over here, I had to reacreate the same crickey bot which was given in our amfoss discord group.
