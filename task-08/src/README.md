# Approach of Task 8
This was a fun and one of the favourite task for me since I am kind of a Pokemon fan. For this task, I created the search window first which included the Search, Capture, and Display button and induced the API URL and completed the three stages. As the Display screen had to be on a seperate window, I had to create seperate python file for it. At the end, I had to connect the main.py with the search window file. After seeing the result, I was so happy that I completed task-08.
