# Approach of Task-00
Well this task took a long time to complete. Dual Boot Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu was hard. First, I had to download Ubuntu and rufus and create a free space for it. I had to also enable Secure Boot and then install Ubuntu and its requirements. I took along time to first install it. But I was happy I completed my first task which is task-00.
