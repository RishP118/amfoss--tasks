# Approach of Task 3
his project was a good exercise in understanding different programming languages. Each language required different syntax and, in some cases, different approaches for input handling and iteration, making it important to learn requirements of each language. The hardest of them all were haskell, elixir and rust. I wouldnt say others were easy but it was a good task.
